        <h3>April Forrest</h3>
        <p>
            Not many coaches can say they have sent students on to win shows like "The Voice" or place on shows like American Idol, and not many can say they have been signed to a major record label themselves. April is proud to say both. <br/><br/>
        
            As a former Universal Motown Recording artist, April has worked with top industry professionals like Ryan Tedder (One Republic) RedOne (Lady Gaga) & Toby Gad (Beyonce) and has done two national tours. As a songwriter April has written and recorded over 200 songs. In addition to this, her extensive background in dance has lent itself nicely to her ability to stage, choreograph and artistic direct many music videos. <br/><br/>â€‹

            April offers a unique vocal method designed to teach even the most inexperienced people how to tap into their potential and read their vocal goals - no matter how big or small.</p>
